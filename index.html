      <h3>Distinguished Seminar: Mechanics & inverse-design of shape-shifting structures</h3>
      <h4>Speaker: Prof. Wim van Rees</h4>
      <p>Recent progress in additive manufacturing and materials engineering has led to a surge of interest in shape­ changing plate and shell ­like structures. Such structures are typically printed in a planar configuration and, when exposed to an ambient stimulus such as heat or humidity, morph into a desired three­-dimensional shape. Viewed through the lens of differential geometry and elasticity, the application of the physical stimulus can be understood as a local change in the metric of a two dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions. In this talk I'll provide a short geometric and mechanic background to this problem, and demonstrate a numerical approach for simulating the elastic response to such a metric change for thin structures. I'll show my theoretical contributions on the inverse ­design of shape­ shifting bilayers, and discuss how these developments have led to the design and experimental realization of a 4D printed lattice that can undergo complex shape changes.

      <h3>Seminar: Transform & Learn: From nonlinear PDEs to low-dimensional polynomial models</h3>  
      <h4>Elizabeth Qian, AeroAstro</h4> 
      <p>This talk presents Transform & Learn, a physics-based approach to learning efficient, low-dimensional models for large-scale nonlinear systems. The proposed method starts from the physics of the problem—in the form of governing partial differential equations (PDEs)—and introduces variable transformations to arrive at a state representation in which the system admits a quadratic formulation. The system can then be parametrized by matrix operators, which can be learned from data. To make the problem computationally tractable, transformed state data are projected onto a low-dimensional global basis. The dense, low-dimensional quadratic model is then learned via a least-squares model learning procedure. We demonstrate our method on model problems in fluid dynamics and combustion applications.

      <h3>Seminar:  Teaching a Neural Network Physics to Help Design Complex Devices</h3>  
      <h4>Sam Raymond, CEE</h4> 
      <p>Starting with the first computational weather forecasts, a ridiculously crazy idea a hundred years ago, we'll see how modern climate models work and why uncertainties in climate predictions are so high despite their sophistication. Then I'll talk about how we're trying to reduce uncertainties in climate predictions by developing a new climate model in Julia that runs on massively parallel GPU accelerators and learns from observations and high-resolution simulations.</p>

      <h3>Seminar: Semiconductor Parameter Extraction (and more!) with Bayesian Inference</h3>  
      <h4>Rachel Kurchin, Materials Science and Engineering</h4> 
      <p>Bayesian parameter estimation is a widely-used approach for model optimization in a variety of fields including astrophysics, high-energy physics, and bioinformatics. However, it has not been adopted extensively for electronic device characterization. We have developed a generalized open-source Python code, Bayesim, that accepts sets of observed data as a function of experimental conditions and modeled data as a function of those same conditions as well as a set of parameters to be fit, and outputs a probability distribution over these parameters, accounting for both experimental and model uncertainty. Because models of electronic devices are frequently computationally expensive, we adopt a deterministic and adaptive scheme for sampling the parameter space and computing model uncertainty. I will discuss applications of the code in fundamental characterization of photovoltaic materials as well as current and planned future features, and leave plenty time for discussion of how Bayesim might be useful for your application!</p>

      <h3>Distinguished Speaker Seminar: Big Data vs. Big Computation</h3>  
      <h4>Prof. Qiqi Wang, AeroAstro</h4> 
      <p>What is the future of computing? Some believe it's big data. For others, it's big computation. Supporters of big data believe that most problems can be solved by gathering huge amounts of data and applying machine learning. Those who believe in big computation, however, postulates that all phenomena in the world can be explained by solving simple physical equations with sufficient computational power. So, who is right?</p>
